# Click Sounds Lite
This is the click sounds mod, except without the default click sound library and some other features.\
To use this, you'll need to select a sound file in the mod settings, otherwise it won't work.\
The mod settings can be opened from the gear icon in the bottom left corner or in the pause menu.\
There are many other features that can be found in the mod settings.

Thanks Dwang-ML for helping with this mod.
