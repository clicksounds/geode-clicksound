# Click Sounds

Plays a click sound whenever you press a jump button, or (optionally) a release sound whenever you release a jump button.
If you want a new built-in click sound or feature to be added, join the [discord server](https://discord.gg/RwbRP8ADdc). <3

### Requires Node-IDs.
Open the mod settings to change the click sound.
